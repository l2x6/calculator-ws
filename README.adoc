= Calculator JAX-WS container for testing WS clients

Based on https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/tree/main/helloworld-ws

== Services

* http://localhost:8080/calculator-ws/CalculatorService?wsdl
* http://localhost:8080/calculator-ws/WssCalculatorService?wsdl

== Configuration

=== `ADD_TO_RESULT`

You can pass `-e ADD_TO_RESULT=1` to the container to get a service instance behaving slightly differently.
This might be useful when testing multiple clients accessing distinct remote endpoints that implement the same interface.

=== `WSS_USER` and `WSS_PASSWORD`

You can use these to set password of the `WssCalculatorService`.
